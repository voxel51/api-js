# Style Guide

This project is implemented in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). We require
all contributed code to adhere to our style. Our priority is consistency, so
that developers can quickly ingest and understand the entire codebase. When in
doubt, follow the existing style in the module you are contributing to.

We mostly follow the [Google JavaScript style](
https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html), so please review it before
contributing.


## Highlights

#### Syntactic Guidelines

- Two space indentations (no tabs)
- Always use single quotes
- `camelCase` for variables/functions
- `CONSTANT_NAME` for constants
- `ClassName` for class names
- Use semicolons to end lines. Be explicit; don't leave it to the
  compiler/engine to decide
- Natural whitespace around punctuation
- Copyright/comment block at the top of every source file
- Library requires/imports are dividied into the following blocks (sorted
  alphabetically within each block):
    - Standard library imports
    - Third-party library imports
    - Application-specific imports

#### Semantic Guidelines

- Use descriptive variable/function names
